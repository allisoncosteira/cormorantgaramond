    Cormorant Garamond is an open-source serif typeface family inspired by 16th-century French types of Claude GaramondLinks to an external site., designed by Christian ThalmannLinks to an external site. and released around 2015. 
    Unlike a direct revival, it was created from scratch to be a modern, elegant display face with features like larger counters for improved readability in various contexts. 
</p>

<p>
    Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) 
    and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) 
    Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts.
</p>

<p>
    While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; 
    when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
